* ALL TESTS ARE DONE ON a4_q1 AND a4_q2 FILES AND NOT THE A4_functions.py FILE*

a4_q1:
	TEST #1:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): RESISTANCE
		Enter the second string (no spaces): ANCESTRIES
		The strings are anagrams!

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test is with an anagram and the inputs are all in uppercase so the program works as expected.

	TEST #2:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): resistance
		Enter the second string (no spaces): ancestries
		The strings are anagrams!

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test is with the same anagram as above but the inputs are all in lowercase. Since the program automatically converts any
			 lower case letters into upper case, the program still works as expected. 

	TEST #3:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): 12313
		Enter the second string (no spaces): 12312.123
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		  File "C:\Users\mpere\Videos\121Assignment4\a4_q1.py", line 14, in <module>
		    if is_anagram(s1, s2):  # if strings are anagrams
		  File "C:\Users\mpere\Videos\121Assignment4\functions.py", line 49, in is_anagram
		    if primeify(string1) == primeify(string2):  # if strings are anagrams
		  File "C:\Users\mpere\Videos\121Assignment4\functions.py", line 38, in primeify
		    prime_product = char_prime(first_char) * primeify(remaining_chars)  # recursively give product of other primes
		  File "C:\Users\mpere\Videos\121Assignment4\functions.py", line 23, in char_prime
		    prime_int = primes[my_char]
		KeyError: '1'
		
		Process finished with exit code 1

		NOTES: This test is run when the user enters an integer and a float. There is currently no instructions for what to do in this case,
			 and so the program returns an error. Some alterations need to be made to the code. 

	TEST #4:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): 2453254
		Enter the second string (no spaces): 1234.234
		Error: please enter a string with no spaces

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test is with the updated code and it works successfully in telling the user the input is invalid. 

	TEST #5:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): some integer 24
		Enter the second string (no spaces): some float 23.24
		Error: please enter a string with no spaces

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test with the updated code was tested with a larger input that has spaces and both an integer and a float. It still worked
			 successfully in not running the program and telling the user the input is invalid. 

a4_q2:
	TEST #1:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): RESISTANCE
		Enter the second string (no spaces): ANCESTRIES
		The strings are anagrams!
		Sorted list of primes: [23265878246710]

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test is when the user enters the strings in all caps and they are an anagram. This test was successfull

	TEST #2:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): admirer
		Enter the second string (no spaces): married
		The strings are anagrams!
		Sorted list of primes: [540371062]

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: This test is when the user enters strings and they are all in lower case. Since the code autmomatically turns the strings into
			 upper case, this test is also successfull. 

	TEST #3:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): python
		Enter the second string (no spaces): java
		The strings are not anagrams.
		Sorted list of primes: [9164, 14016057389]

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: In this test the user enters 2 strings that are not anagrams, the program still ran fine and instead of displaying the sum of the
			 primes for the anagram it displays both sums for both strings. 

	TEST #4:

		Enter the first string (no spaces): test with integers and spaces 31231
		Enter the second string (no spaces): test with floats and spaces 1231.123
		Error: please enter a string with no spaces

		Process finished with exit code 0

		NOTES: In this test the user enters spaces and integers/floats and the program tells the user the input is invalid so this test is successful
			 in telling the user that their input is invalid.
