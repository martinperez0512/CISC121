def create_standard_rooms():

    This function creates all the standard room objects and stores them in a list that is returned to the main program.
    The reason why in line it says (i + 100) is so that the room gets a unique room number and + 100 is to show that it
    is on the first floor (room 101, 124 etc.). The same is true for the other room types but since they are on
    different floors it shows i + 200 and i + 300.
